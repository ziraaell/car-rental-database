1. Clone repository
 ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/ziraaell/Car-Rental-Databases-Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directiory:
 ```bash 
  cd Car-Rental-Databases-Project
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment using Anaconda (optional but recommended):
```bash 
  conda create -n rental_env
  conda activate rental_env
```

4. Install the required libraries:
```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create the database using the 'baza.sql' file:
   - Ensure you have an active PostgreSQL instance. This can be hosted locally, on Tembo, or any other PostgreSQL hosting service.
   - Run the following command to create the database structure and insert initial data:


     ```bash 
     psql -h [hostname] -U [username] -W -d [database_name] < baza.sql
     ```

6. Configure the .env file with database settings:
   - Create a .env file in the root directory and add:


     ```bash 
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[username]:[password]@[hostname]:[port]/[database_name]
     ```
        
7. Run the application locally:
   ```bash 
      flask run
    ```
   
  The application will be awailable at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
